## Passwords Tested

| Password                       | Complexity Level | Description                         |
|--------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `apple123`                     | Weak             | Lowercase + numbers                 |
| `Apple123`                     | Moderate         | Upper + lower + numbers             |
| `Apple@123`                    | Strong           | Upper + lower + numbers + symbol    |
| `@pple1234Secure!`             | Very Strong      | Complex + longer                    |
| `A!1pL3x9#`                    | Very Strong      | Randomized secure password          |
| `thisisaverylongpasswordwithoutsymbols123` | Strong | Long but lacks symbols          |

## Tools Used

Passwordmeter [https://passwordmeter.com]

## Best Practices

- Use at least **12â€“16 characters**
- Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
- Avoid **dictionary words** or personal info
- Use **random and unique** passwords per site
- Store them using a **password manager**
- Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)**

---

## Conclusion

Password strength is a crucial layer of security. Combining length, randomness, and complexity dramatically increases resistance to common attacks. This project demonstrates how thoughtful password design, combined with tools like 2FA and password managers, can protect users against threats.
